*  Name:
*     cupidREdges

*  Purpose:
*     Identify peaks and peak edges in a 1D line of data.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Synopsis:
*     void cupidREdges( int nel, double *dval, int *dpos, int *mask,
*                       int minpix, double thresh, double noise, double rms,
*                       double flatslope, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function finds the highest data value in the supplied 1D line
*     of data. It then works outwards on both sides of this peak position
*     looking for the edges of the peak. When found, the pixels
*     corresponding to the edge are flagged as edge pixels in the
*     supplied 3D mask array so long as they encompass more than a given
*     number of pixels, and the peak position is flagged as a peak in the
*     mask. The 1D line of data is then rescanned looking for the next
*     highest peak, and the edges of this peak are also flagged in the mask.
*     This procedure is repeated until all peaks above the given threshhold
*     value have been found.

*  Parameters:
*     nel
*        The number of elements in the "dval" and "dpos" arrays.
*     dval
*        Pointer to an array holding the data values at each point in the
*        1D line of data.
*     dpos
*        Pointer to an array holding the 1D vector index within the "mask"
*        array corresponding to each data value in the 1D line of data.
*        On exit, all pixels contained within any peak are set to -1.
*     mask
*        Pointer to the mask array. Edge pixels are set to 1 on exit.
*     minpix
*        The minimum number of pixels (including the edge pixels) which must
*        be spanned by a peak in order for its edges to be marked in the
*        returned mask.
*     thresh
*        The smallest significant peak height. The edges of peaks which are
*        below this limit are not included in the returned mask.
*     noise
*        Defines the data value below which pixels are considered to be in
*        the noise. A peak is considered to end when the peak value dips
*        below the "noise" value.
*     rms
*        The RMS noise in the data
*     flatslope
*        The minimum significant slope along a peak, in units of change
*        in data value per pixel.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status value.
