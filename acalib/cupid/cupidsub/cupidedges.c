*  Name:
*     cupidEdges

*  Purpose:
*     Find the edges of areas within a constant integer value.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Synopsis:
*     void cupidEdges( float *mask, int nel, int dims[ 3 ], int skip[ 3 ],
*                      float on, float off, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function produces an output array which marks the edges of the
*     areas within the input array that hold a specified "on" value.
*
*     Each output pixel value is created in turn as follows: If the
*     corresponding input pixel has the "on" value and is also
*     completely surrounded by pixel with the "on" value, then the
*     output pixel is set to the "off" value. If the input pixel has
*     the "on" value but has at least one neighbour that is not set to
*     the "on" value, then the output pixel is set to the "on" value.
*     If the input pixel is not set to the "on" value then the output is
*     set to the "off" value.

*  Parameters:
*     mask
*        The mask array.
*     nel
*        The number of elements in the "in" array.
*     dims
*        The number of pixels along each pixel axis of the arrays.
*     skip
*        The increment in 1D vector index required to move a distance of 1
*        pixel along each axis. This allows conversion between indexing
*        the array using a single 1D vector index and using nD coords.
*     on
*        The on value.
*     off
*        The off value.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status value.
