 * *  Name:
 * *     cgeneric.h
 * *  Purpose:
 * *     Include file for standardising generic C code.
 * *  Language:
 * *     C
 * *  Type of Module:
 * *     C include file
 * *  Description:
 * *     This include files defines macros that should be used when generating
 * *     generic code in C. To use it you need to follow the recipe described
 * *     here:
 * *
 * *        - Create your generic code routines in an include file with extension
 * *          ".cgen". There are several macros defined for use when defining
 * *          generic functions.
 * *
 * *          -- CGEN_BAD
 * *          -- CGEN_MAX
 * *          -- CGEN_MIN
 * *          -- CGEN_FUNCTION
 * *          -- CGEN_HDS_TYPE
 * *          -- CGEN_TYPE
 * *          -- CGEN_BIG_TYPE
 * *
 * *          You need to use CGEN_FUNCTION as part of the normal function
 * *          declaration so that generic forms of the function name can be
 * *          used. Each routine in a generic file should start:
 * *
 * *             return_type CGEN_FUNCTION(function_name) ( arg decs )
 * *
 * *          So a routine called kpg1_bad that returned an int and accepted a
 * *          CGEN_CTYPE pointer, called value, would be defined as:
 * *
 * *             int CGEN_FUNCTION(kpg1_bad) (CGEN_CTYPE *value) {
 * *                 if ( value[0] == CGEN_BAD ) {
 * *                    return 1;
 * *                 }
 * *                 return 0;
 * *             }
 * *
 * *          with the trivial job of testing the first element of an array
 * *          against the BAD value contant.
 * *
 * *          The value of CGEN_TYPE will be set to the C type, that is
 * *          double, float, int, short int, unsigned short int, char,
 * *          unsigned char, and int64_t as appropriate.
 * *
 * *          The value of CGEN_BAD will be set to one of the PRM constants
 * *          VAL__BADD, VAL__BADR etc. as appropriate. Likewise, CGEN_MAX
 * *          and CGEN_MIN will be set to the corresponding PRM constants.
 * *
 * *          The value of CGEN_BAD will be set to one of the PRM constants
 * *          VAL__BADD, VAL__BADR etc. as appropriate.
 * *
 * *          The value of CGEN_HDS_TYPE will be set to the HDS type of the
 * *          current type, one of "_DOUBLE", "_REAL", "_INTEGER", "_WORD"
 * *          "_UWORD", "_BYTE", "_UBYTE" or "_INT64".
 * *
 * *          CGEN_BIG_TYPE is a type that is fundamentally the same type
 * *          as CGEN_TYPE but can have more precision. For example, int vs
 * *          long, or float vs double. Can be used when you need to accumulate
 * *          values of type CGEN_TYPE.
 * *
 * *        - Create a C file that includes the generic code, once for each of
 * *          the data types you want (this file can also contain related
 * *          non-generic code). To do this define the macro CGEN_CODE_TYPE to be
 * *          one of the values:
 * *
 * *             CGEN_DOUBLE_TYPE, CGEN_FLOAT_TYPE, CGEN_INT_TYPE,
 * *             CGEN_WORD_TYPE, CGEN_UWORD_TYPE, CGEN_BYTE_TYPE
 * *             CGEN_UBYTE_TYPE, CGEN_INT64_TYPE
 * *
 * *          to select the data type required. Then include the file
 * *          "cgeneric_defs.h" followed by your generic include file,
 * *          (called "mygenerics.cgen" in the following example):
 * *
 * *             #include <prm_par.h>
 * *             #include <cgeneric.h>
 * *
 * *             #define CGEN_CODE_TYPE CGEN_DOUBLE_TYPE
 * *             #include "cgeneric_defs.h"
 * *             #include "mygenerics.cgen"
 * *             #undef CGEN_CODE_TYPE
 * *
 * *             #define CGEN_CODE_TYPE CGEN_INT_TYPE
 * *             #include "cgeneric_defs.h"
 * *             #include "mygenerics.cgen"
 * *             #undef CGEN_CODE_TYPE
 * *
 * *          Which generates code for double and int routines when
 * *          the C file is compiled.
 * *
 * *        - Use the generic routines. The function names will
 * *          have the character codes "D", "F", "I", "W", "UW",
 * *          "B", "UB", and "K" appended to their declared names. So
 * *          for our example "kpg1_bad", we have the two functions
 * *          "kpg1_badD" and "kpg1_badI".
 * *  Notes:
 * *     Should look at how to declare prototypes.
