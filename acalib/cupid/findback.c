void findback( int *status ){
/*
*+
*  Name:
*     FINDBACK

*  Purpose:
*     Estimate the background in an NDF by removing small scale structure.

*  Language:
*     C

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Synopsis:
*     void findback( int *status );

*  Description:
*     This application uses spatial filtering to remove structure with a
*     scale size less than a specified size from a 1, 2, or 3 dimensional
*     NDF, thus producing an estimate of the local background within the NDF.
*
*     The algorithm proceeds as follows. A filtered form of the input data
*     is first produced by replacing every input pixel by the minimum of
*     the input values within a rectangular box centred on the pixel.
*     This filtered data is then filtered again, using a filter that
*     replaces every pixel value by the maximum value in a box centred on
*     the pixel. This produces an estimate of the lower envelope of the data,
*     but usually contains unacceptable sharp edges. In addition, this
*     filtered data has a tendency to hug the lower envelope of the
*     noise, thus under-estimating the true background of the noise-free
*     data. The first problem is minimised by smoothing the background
*     estimate using a filter that replaces every pixel value by the mean
*     of the values in a box centred on the pixel. The second problem
*     is minimised by estimating the difference between the input data
*     and the background estimate within regions well removed from any
*     bright areas. This difference is then extrapolated into the bright
*     source regions and used as a correction to the background estimate.
*     Specifically, the residuals between the input data and the initial
*     background estimate are first formed, and residuals which are more
*     than three times the RMS noise are set bad. The remaining residuals
*     are smoothed with a mean filter. This smoothing will replace a lot
*     of the bad values rejected above, but may not remove them all. Any
*     remaining bad values are estimated by linear interpolation between
*     the nearest good values along the first axis. The interpolated
*     residuals are then smoothed again using a mean filter, to get a
*     surface representing the bias in the initial background estimate.
*     This surface is finally added onto the initial background estimate
*     to obtain the output NDF.

*  Usage:
*     findback in out box

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BOX() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The dimensions of each of the filters, in pixels. Each value
*        should be odd (if an even value is supplied, the next higher odd
*        value will be used). The number of values supplied should not
*        exceed the number of significant (i.e. more than one element)
*        pixel axes in the input array. If any trailing values of 1 are
*        supplied, then each pixel value on the corresponding axes
*        will be fitted independently of its neighbours. For instance,
*        if the data array is 3-dimensional, and the third BOX value is 1,
*        then each x-y plane will be fitted independently of the neighbouring
*        planes. If the NDF has more than 1 pixel axis but only 1 value is
*        supplied, then the same value will be used for the both the first
*        and second pixel axes (a value of 1 will be assumed for the third
*        axis if the input array is 3-dimensional).
*     MSG_FILTER = _CHAR (Read)
*        Controls the amount of diagnostic information reported. This is the
*        standard messaging level. The default messaging level is NORM (2).
*        A value of NONE or 0 will suppress all screen output. VERB (3) will
*        indicate progress through the various stages of the algorithm. [NORM]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF.
*     RMS = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        Specifies a value to use as the global RMS noise level in the
*        supplied data array. The suggested default value is the square root
*        of the mean of the values in the input NDF's Variance component.
*        If the NDF has no Variance component, the suggested default
*        is based on the differences between neighbouring pixel values,
*        measured over the entire input NDF. If multiple slices within the
*        NDF are to be processed independently (see parameter BOX), it
*        may be more appropriate for a separate default RMS to be calculated
*        for each slice. This will normally be the case if the noise could
*        be different in each of the slices. In such cases a null (!) can
*        be supplied for the RMS parameter, which forces a separate
*        default RMS value to be found and used for each slice. Any
*        pixel-to-pixel correlation in the noise can result in these
*        defaults being too low.
*     SUB = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied, the output NDF will contain the
*        difference between the supplied input data and the estimated
*        background. If a FALSE value is supplied, the output NDF will
*        contain the estimated background itself. [FALSE]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF containing either the estimated background, or the
*        background-subtracted input data, as specified by parameter SUB.
*     WLIM = _REAL (Read)
*        If the input NDF contains bad pixels, then this parameter
*        may be used to determine the number of good pixels which must
*        be present within the filter box before a valid output
*        pixel is generated.  It can be used, for example, to prevent
*        output pixels from being generated in regions where there are
*        relatively few good pixels to contribute to the filtered
*        result.
*
*        If a null (!) value is used for WLIM, the pattern of bad pixels
*        is propagated from the input NDF to the output NDF unchanged. In
*        this case, filtered output values are only calculated for those
*        pixels which are not bad in the input NDF.
*
*        If a numerical value is given for WLIM, then it specifies the
*        minimum fraction of good pixels which must be present in the
*        filter box in order to generate a good output pixel.  If
*        this specified minimum fraction of good input pixels is not
*        present, then a bad output pixel will result, otherwise a
*        filtered output value will be calculated.  The value of this
*        parameter should lie between 0.0 and 1.0 (the actual number
*        used will be rounded up if necessary to correspond to at least
*        1 pixel). [0.3]

*  Notes:
*     - Smoothing cubes in 3 dimensions can be very slow.

*     13-SEP-2006 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     19-MAR-2007 (DSB):
*        - Added parameters SUB and RMS.
*        - Fix bug that left the output NDF uninitialised if ILEVEL is set
*        non-zero.
*        - Use generic data type handling as in FINDCLUMPS.
*     14-JAN-2009 (TIMJ):
*        Use MERS for message filtering.
*     29-JUL-2009 (TIMJ):
*        Rename ILEVEL to MSG_FILTER
*     17-MAY-2011 (DSB):
*        Use sqrt rather than sqrtf when calculating RMS.
*     12-SEP-2011 (DSB):
*        Process slices in separate threads.
*     5-APR-2013 (DSB):
*        Use thrGetWorkforce instead of thrCreateWorkforce in order to
*        avoid accumulation of rsource usage associated with each new
*        created workforce, which can be a problem when running from a
*        monolith. And do not delete the singleton workforce.
*     10-JUL-2013 (DSB):
*        - Added parameter WLIM.
*        - Fixed incorrect lower bounds when any insignificant axes are 
*        present (this only affected debugging tools).
