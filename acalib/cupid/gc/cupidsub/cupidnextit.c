*  Name:
*     cupidNextIt

*  Purpose:
*     Returned the next pixel to be processed in a rectangular subsection
*     of a 3D array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Synopsis:
*     int cupidNextIt( CupidBoxIter *iter, int xx[3], int *iv, int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns the 1D vector index and 3D grid indices of the
*     next pixel to be processed in a rectangular subsection of a 3D array,
*     as specified by a supplied CupidBoxIter structure, which should have
*     been created using cupidBoxIterator, and acts rather like a Java
*     Iterator.
*
*     Upon return, the CupidBoxIter structure is modified so that it
*     refers to the next pixel in the array subsection (in natural fortran
*     order).

*  Parameters:
*     iter
*        Pointer to the CupidBoxIter structure describing the subsection
*        of the array to be processed, as created by cupidBoxIterator.
*     xx
*        Array in which to return the 3D grid indices of the next pixel
*        to be processed.
*     iv
*        Pointer to an int in which to return the 1D vector index of the
*        next pixel to be processed, within the array defined by the "dim"
*        argument passed to cupidBoxIterator when the CupidBoxIter was created.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status value.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if there was at least one more pixel
*     yet to be visited by the iterator on entry to this function. If the
*     supplied iterator has already visited all pixels, then a zero value
*     is returned.
