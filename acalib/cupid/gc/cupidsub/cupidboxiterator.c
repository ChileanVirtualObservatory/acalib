*  Name:
*     cupidBoxIterator

*  Purpose:
*     Create an iterator that iterates round the pixels within a
*     rectangular section of a 3D array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Synopsis:
*     CupidBoxIter *cupidBoxIterator( CupidBoxIter *iter, int dim[3],
*                                     int lbnd[3], int ubnd[3], int gap,
*                                     int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function returns a pointer to a structure that can be passed
*     to cupidNextIt in order to determine the next pixel to process in a
*     rectangular section of a 3D array. The pixels are processed in
*     natural fortran order. The structure behaves rather like a Java
*     "Iterator".
*
*     If the supplied region overlaps the edge of the array, then the
*     iterator will skip over pixels that fall outside the bounds of the
*     array.

*  Parameters:
*     iter
*        A pointer to an existing CupidBoxIter structure, or NULL. If
*        supplied, the contents of this structure will be reset to describe
*        the required set of pixels, and the supplied pointer will be
*        returned as the function value. If a NULL pointer is supplied,
*        memory will be allocated to hold a new CupidBoxIter structure to
*        describe the required set of pixels, and this new pointer will be
*        returned a the function value.
*     dim
*        The dimensions of the array in which the pixel reside.
*     lbnd
*        The lower bounds of the rectangular array secton to be iterated
*        over, in grid indices.
*     ubnd
*        The upper bounds of the rectangular array secton to be iterated
*        over, in grid indices.
*     gap
*        The gap between adjacent pixels visited by the iterator. If a
*        value of 1 or less is supplied then all pixels are visited. If
*        (say) a value of 2 is supplied,then every other pixel will be
*        visited, every other row will be visited, and every other plane
*        will be visited.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status value.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to a structure describing the next pixel to be processed
*     in the rectangular section (this will initially be the pixel
*     specified by "lbnd"). This can be passed to cupidNextIt in order to
*     get a pointer to the array data value, and the explicit (x,y,z)
*     grid indices of the pixel. It should be freed using astFree when no
*     longer needed.
