*  Name:
*     cupidFindback2<X>

*  Purpose:
*     Reject values larger than 3 times the noise level from the supplied
*     data array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Synopsis:
*     void cupidFindback2<X>( double rms, int dim[3], CGEN_TYPE *din,
*                             int *status )

*  Description:
*     This function sets all elements of the supplied array bad that are
*     greater than 6 times the RMS noise in the data.

*  Parameters:
*     rms
*        The RMS noise in the data.
*     dim
*        The dimensions of the supplied array.
*     din
*        Pointer to the start of the supplied data array.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status value.

*  History:
*     13-SEP-2006 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     23-MAR-2007 (DSB):
*        Changed rejection criterion from 3*sigma to 6*sigma. This is
*        because the supplied array represents the rediausl between the
*        data and the *lower* enevelope of the noise. Therefore. assuming
*        the noise extends to 3*sigma above and below the mean, the
*        difference between the upper envelope and hte lower envelope
*        should be 6*sigma.
