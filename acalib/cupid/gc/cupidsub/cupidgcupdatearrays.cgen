*  Name:

*  Purpose:
*     Remove the fit from the residuals array.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Synopsis:
*     void cupidGCUpdateArrays<X>( CGEN_TYPE *res, CGEN_TYPE *ipd, int nel,
*                                  int ndim, int *dims, double *par,

*  Description:
*     This function removes the supplied Gaussian from the residuals array
*     (it does not remove the backgroudd level). It also creates an NDF
*     holding the data values associated with the clump.

*  Parameters:
*     res
*        Pointer to the start of the residuals array. May be NULL.
*     ipd
*        Pointer to the start of the supplied data array. May be NULL.
*     nel
*        The number of elements in the supplied array.
*     ndim
*        The number of pixel axes in the array.
*     dims
*        The number of pixels on each pixel axis of the array, using
*        external axis ordering (i.e. the axis ordering within the data file).
*     par
*        Pointer to an array holding the parameters describing thw Gaussian
*        clump to be removed from the residuals array.
*     rms
*        The RMS noise level.
*     mlim
*        The lowest value (normalised to the RMS noise level) at which
*        model Gaussian should be evaluated.
*     imax
*        Index within "res" of highest value (only used if "res" is not
*        NULL).
*     thresh
*        Peaks lower than "thresh" are not include din the output
*        catalogue or NDF. Note, "thresh" is given in units of the RMS
*        noise.
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to array holding the pixel indices of the first pixel in
*        the user-supplied NDF.
*     ndfs
*        Pointer to a location containing an HDS locator for an array of
*        NDF structures. If the HDS locator is NULL on entry a new HDS
*        object is created and its locator stored in place of the NULL
*        pointer. The array of NDF structures is extended by one, and the
*        new NDF in the array describes the supplied clump. If the
*        supplied pointer is NULL, no HDS array or NDF is created. No NDF
*        is created for clumps which touch the edge of the data array.
*        The new NDF will have a Unit value of "BAD" if the clump touches
*        too many areas of bad pixels in the supplied data array.
*     iclump
*        Clump index.
*     excols
*        Include extra columns in the output catalogue holding GaussClumps
*        specific values? Zero produces no extra info. One causes the
*        gaussian FWHMs and spatial position angle to be included. Two
*        causes more info to be included.
*     mean_peak
*        The mean value of the most recent fitted peak values.
*     maxbad
*        Largest allowed fraction of bad pixels in a clump.
*     area
*        Pointer to an int in which to store the number of pixels
*        contributing to the clump.
*     sumclumps
*        The supplied value is incremented by the sum of the data values
*        in the fitted Gaussian.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status value.

*  Notes:
*     - This function can be invoked using the generic cupidGCUpdateArrays macro
*     defined in cupid.h. This macro has the same parameter list as
*     cupidGCUpdateArrays<X> except that an extra parameter is added to the start
*     of the parameter list indicating the data type of the specific
*     cupidGCUpdateArrays... function to be invoked. This extra parameter should
*     be an integer and should be one of CUPID__DOUBLE, CUPID__FLOAT, etc.

*     17-AUG-2007 (DSB):
*        Add velocity gradient to "extracols" information.
*     14-JAN-2008 (TIMJ):
*        Use msgOutif instead of ilevel
*     26-JAN-2011 (DSB):
*        Add spatial position angle to "extracols" information.
*     7-FEB-2011 (DSB):
*        Continue checking all faces to see if any need to be extended,
*        until none need to be extended. Previously, faces were no longer
*        checked when the one face itself did not rise above mlim. But
*        extending other faces may cause such faces to include higher
*        values, so all faces should continue to be checked.
*     26-SEP-2011 (DSB):
*        Add argument "thresh".
