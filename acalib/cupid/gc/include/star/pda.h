*  Name:
*     pda.h

*  Purpose:
*     Define the C interface to the PDA library.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Description:
*     This module defines the C interface to the functions of the PDA
*     library. The file pda.c contains C wrappers for the Fortran
*     PDA routines.

*  Notes:
*     - Given the size of the PDA library, providing a complete C
*     interface is probably not worth the effort. Instead, I suggest that
*     people who want to use PDA from C extend this file (and
*     pda.c) to include any functions which they need but which are
*     not already included.
