*  Name:
*     MAKECLUMPS

*  Purpose:
*     Create simulated data containing clumps and noise.

*  Language:
*     C

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Description:
*     This application creates a new 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional NDF containing
*     a collection of clumps with background noise. It also creates a
*     catalogue containing the clump parameters.
*
*     The clumps profiles are Gaussian, with elliptical isophotes. The
*     values of each parameter defining the clump shape can be either
*     fixed at a constant value or selected from a given probability
*     distribution. The clump positions can be distributed randomly, or
*     may be on a regular grid (see parameter GRID).

*  Usage:
*     makeclumps out outcat

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     ANGLE( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        Defines the distribution from which the spatial position angle of
*        the major axis of the elliptical clump is chosen. Values should
*        be supplied in units of degrees. See parameter  PARDIST for
*        additional information. Note, angles are always taken from a
*        uniform distribution, irrespective of the setting of PARDIST.
*        [current value]
*     BEAMFWHM = _REAL (Read)
*        The spatial FHWM (Full Width at Half Max) of the instrumental beam,
*        in pixels. The generated clumps are smoothed with a Gaussian beam
*        of this FWHM, before noise is added. No spatial smoothing is
*        performed if BEAMFWHM is zero. See also parameter PRECAT.
*        [current value]
*     DECONV = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the clump properties stored in the output catalogue
*        will be modified to take account of the smoothing caused by the
*        instrumental beam width. Note, if parameter PRECAT is TRUE,
*        then this deconvolution has no effect since no smoothing has
*        been applied to the clumps at the time when the catalogue is
*        created. [TRUE]
*     FWHM1( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        Defines the distribution from which the FWHM (Full Width at Half
*        Max) for pixel axis 1 of each clump is chosen. Values should be
*        supplied in units of pixel. See parameter PARDIST for additional
*        information. [current value]
*     FWHM2( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        Defines the distribution from which the FWHM (Full Width at Half
*        Max) for pixel axis 2 of each clump is chosen. Values should be
*        supplied in units of pixel. See parameter PARDIST for additional
*        information. [current value]
*     FWHM3( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        Defines the distribution from which the FWHM (Full Width at Half
*        Max) for pixel axis 3 of each clump is chosen. Values should be
*        supplied in units of pixel. See parameter PARDIST for additional
*        information. [current value]
*     GRID = _INTEGER (Read)
*        If null (!), the clump centres are distributed randomly over the
*        array. If not null, the clump centres are positioned on a regular
*        grid with dimensions specified by parameter NCLUMPS. The grid
*        occupies the entire output array, excluding a border of width
*        equal to the integer value supplied for parameter GRID (in
*        pixels). [!]
*     LBND() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The lower pixel bounds of the output NDF. The number of values
*        supplied (1, 2 or 3) defines the number of pixel axes in the output
*        NDF (an error is reported if the number of values supplied for LBND
*        and UBND differ). If an NDF is supplied for parameter LIKE, the
*        suggested defaults for this parameter will be the lower pixel
*        bounds of the supplied NDF.
*     LIKE = NDF (Read)
*        An NDF from which to inherited WCS information. If a null (!)
*        value is supplied, the output catalogue will hold values in
*        pixel coordinates, and there will be no WCS in any of the output
*        NDFs. [!]
*     MODEL = NDF (Write)
*        The NDF to receive the simulated data, excluding noise. A CUPID
*        extension is added to this NDF, containing information about each
*        clump in the same format as produced by the FINDCLUMPS command. This
*        includes an NDF holding an of the individual clump.
*     NCLUMP() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of clumps to create. If parameter GRID is null (!),
*        a single value should be supplied, and the specified number of
*        clumps are positioned randomly over the output array. If
*        parameter GRID is not null, the number of values supplied should
*        match the number of pixel axes in the output array, and each
*        value is then the number of clumps along the corresponding
*        pixel axis. Note, any clumps that touch an edge of the aray will
*        be excluded from the output array.
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The NDF to receive the simulated data, including instrumental
*        blurring and noise.
*     OUTCAT = FILENAME (Write)
*        The output catalogue in which to store the clump parameters.
*        There will be one row per clump, with the following columns:
*
*        - Peak1: The position of the clump peak value on axis 1.
*        - Peak2: The position of the clump peak value on axis 2.
*        - Peak3: The position of the clump peak value on axis 3.
*        - Cen1: The position of the clump centroid on axis 1.
*        - Cen2: The position of the clump centroid on axis 2.
*        - Cen3: The position of the clump centroid on axis 3.
*        - Size1: The size of the clump along pixel axis 1.
*        - Size2: The size of the clump along pixel axis 2.
*        - Size3: The size of the clump along pixel axis 3.
*        - Sum: The total data sum in the clump.
*        - Peak: The peak value in the clump.
*        - Volume: The total number of pixels falling within the clump.
*
*        There is also an optional column called "Shape" containing an
*        STC-S description of the spatial coverage of each clump. See
*        parameter SHAPE.
*
*        The coordinate system used to describe the peak and centroid
*        positions is determined by the value supplied for parameter
*        LIKE. If LIKE is null (!), then positions are specified in the
*        pixel coordinate system. In addition, the clump sizes are specified
*        in units of pixels, and the clump volume is specified in units of
*        cubic pixels (square pixels for 2D data). If an NDF is supplied
*        for LIKE, then positions are specified in the current coordinate
*        system of the specified NDF. In addition, the clump sizes and
*        volumes are specified in WCS units. Note, the sizes are still
*        measured parallel to the pixel axes, but are recorded in WCS units
*        rather than pixel units. Celestial coordinate positions are units
*        of degrees, sizes are in units are arc-seconds, and areas in square
*        arc-seconds. Spectral coordinates are in the units displayed by the
*        KAPPA command "ndftrace".
*
*        If the data has less than 3 pixel axes, then the columns
*        describing the missing axes will not be present in the catalogue.
*
*        The catalogue inherits any WCS information from the NDF supplied
*        for parameter LIKE.
*
*        The "size" of the clump on an axis is the RMS deviation of each
*        pixel centre from the clump centroid, where each pixel is
*        weighted by the correspinding pixel data value. This excludes
*        the instrumental smoothing specified by BEAMFWHM and VELFWHM.
*
*        The KAPPA command "listshow" can be used to draw markers at the
*        central positions of the clumps described in a catalogue. For
*        instance, the command "listshow fred plot=mark" will draw
*        markers identifying the positions of the clumps described in
*        file fred.FIT, overlaying the markers on top of the currently
*        displayed image. Specifying "plot=STCS" instead of "plot=mark"
*        will cause the spatial outline of the clump to be drawn if it is
*        present in the catalogue (see parameter SHAPE).
*     PARDIST = LITERAL (Read)
*        The shape of the distribution from which clump parameter values are
*        chosen. Can be "Normal", "Uniform" or "Poisson". The distribution
*        for each clump parameter is specified by its own ADAM parameter
*        containing two values; the mean and the width of the distribution.
*        If PARDIST is "Normal", the width is the standard deviation. If
*        PARDIST is "Uniform", the width is half the range between the
*        maximum and minimum parameter values. In either of these two cases,
*        if a width of zero is supplied, the relevant parameter is given a
*        constant value equal to the specified mean.  If PARDIST is
*        "Poisson", the width is ignored. [current value]
*     PEAK( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        Defines the distribution from which the peak value (above the
*        local background) of each clump is chosen. See parameter PARDIST
*        for additional information. [current value]
*     PRECAT = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If FALSE, the output catalogue is created from the clumps after
*        the instrumental smoothing specified by parameters BEAMFWHM and
*        VELFWHM has been applied. If TRUE, the catalogue is created from
*        the data before the instrumental smoothing is applied (in which
*        case parameter DECONV has no effect). [FALSE]
*     RMS = _REAL (Read)
*        The RMS (Gaussian) noise to be added to the output data. [current value]
*     SHAPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the shape that should be used to describe the spatial
*        coverage of each clump in the output catalogue. It can be set to
*        "None", "Polygon" or "Ellipse". If it is set to "None", the
*        spatial shape of each clump is not recorded in the output
*        catalogue. Otherwise, the catalogue will have an extra column
*        named "Shape" holding an STC-S description of the spatial coverage
*        of each clump. "STC-S" is a textual format developed by the IVOA
*        for describing regions within a WCS - see
*        http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/STC-S.html for details.
*        These STC-S desriptions can be displayed by the KAPPA:LISTSHOW
*        command, or using GAIA. Since STC-S cannot describe regions within
*        a pixel array, it is necessary to provide an NDF to define the
*        WCS (using parameter LIKE) if using this option. An error will be
*        reported if the WCS in the NDF does not contain a pair of celestial
*        sky axes.
*
*        - Polygon: Each polygon will have, at most, 15 vertices. If the data
*        is 2-dimensional, the polygon is a fit to the clump's outer boundary
*        (the region containing all godo data values). If the data is
*        3-dimensional, the spatial footprint of each clump is determined
*        by rejecting the least significant 10% of spatial pixels, where
*        "significance" is measured by the number of spectral channels that
*        contribute to the spatial pixel. The polygon is then a fit to
*        the outer boundary of the remaining spatial pixels.
*
*        - Ellipse: All data values in the clump are projected onto the
*        spatial plane and "size" of the collapsed clump at four different
*        position angles - all separated by 45 degrees - is found (see the
*        OUTCAT parameter for a description of clump "size"). The ellipse
*        that generates the same sizes at the four position angles is then
*        found and used as the clump shape.
*
*        In general, "Ellipse" will outline the brighter, inner regions
*        of each clump, and "Polygon" will include the fainter outer
*        regions. ["None"]
*     TRUNC = _REAL (Read)
*        The level (above the local background) at which clumps should be
*        truncated to zero, given as a fraction of the noise level specified
*        by RMS. [current value]
*     UBND() = _INTEGER (Read)
*        The upper pixel bounds of the output NDF. The number of values
*        supplied (1, 2 or 3) defines the number of pixel axes in the output
*        NDF (an error is reported if the number of values supplied for LBND
*        and UBND differ). If an NDF is supplied for parameter LIKE, the
*        suggested defaults for this parameter will be the upper pixel
*        bounds of the supplied NDF.
*     VELFWHM = _REAL (Read)
*        The FWHM of the Gaussian velocity resolution of the instrument, in
*        pixels. The generated clumps are smoothed on the velocity axis with
*        a Gaussian beam of this FWHM, before noise is added. No velocity
*        smoothing is performed if VELFWHM is zero. See also parameter PRECAT.
*        [current value]
*     VGRAD1( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        Defines the distribution from which the projection of the internal
*        velocity gradient vector onto pixel axis 1 of each clump is chosen.
*        Values should be supplied in dimensionless units of "velocity
*        pixels per spatial pixel". See parameter PARDIST for additional
*        information. [current value]
*     VGRAD2( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        Defines the distribution from which the projection of the internal
*        velocity gradient vector onto pixel axis 2 of each clump is chosen.
*        Values should be supplied in dimensionless units of "velocity
*        pixels per spatial pixel". See parameter PARDIST for additional
*        information. [current value]

*  Notes:
*     - If 3D data is created, pixel axes 1 and 2 are the spatial axes,
*     and pixel axis 3 is the velocity axis.
*     - The positions of the clumps are chosen from a uniform
*     distribution on each axis.
