void cupid_mon( int *status ) {

*  Name:
*     cupid_mon

*  Purpose:
*     Top-level CUPID function for A-task monolith on UNIX.

*  Language:
*     Starlink C

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Description:
*     This is the top-level A-task monolith function for the CUPID
*     suite of A-tasks.  Each CUPID command is an alias to a softlink
*     that points to this monolith.  The chosen command is obtained
*     from the ADAM routine TASK_GET_NAME.  The command may be specified
*     from the shell or ICL.  Given the command, the requested A-task
*     is called after a successful matching of the input string with a
*     valid task name.  If there is no match, an error report is made.

*  Parameters:
*     status
*        Pointer to the global status variable used by the ADAM fixed part.

*  Synopsis:
*     void cupid_mon( int *status );

*  History:
*     28-SEP-2005 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     29-JUL-2009 (TIMJ):
*        Call taskGetName rather than Fortran.
*        Add CUPID and version number to NDF history.
*     31-JUL-2009 (DSB):
*        Use ndgBegpv/Endpv to provide automatic provenance propagation.
*     16-OCT-2009 (DSB):
*        Use ndgBeggh/ndgEndgh to record contents of group parameters in
*        the history component of output NDFs.
*     2011-01-19 (TIMJ):
*        Add leak checking to CUPID monolith
*     5-APR-2013 (DSB):
*        Use astCheckMemory rather than astFlushMemory since we do not want
*        to free the memory used to hold the singleton workforce returned by
*        thrGetWorkforce.
