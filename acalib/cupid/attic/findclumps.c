*  Name:
*     FINDCLUMPS

*  Purpose:
*     Identify clumps of emission within a 1, 2 or 3 dimensional NDF.

*  Language:
*     C

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Synopsis:
*     void findclumps( int *status );

*  Description:
*     This application identifies clumps of emission within a 1, 2 or 3
*     dimensional NDF. It is assumed that any background has already been
*     removed from the data array (for instance, using CUPID:FINDBACK).
*     Information about the clumps is returned in several different ways:
*
*     - A pixel mask identifying pixels as background, clump or edge
*     pixels is written to the Quality array of each output NDF (see
*     parameters OUT and QOUT). Three quality bits will be used; one
*     is set if and only if the pixel is contained within one or more
*     clumps, another is set if and only if the pixel is not contained within
*     any clump, and the other is set if and only if the pixel is in a
*     clump but on the edge of the clump (i.e. has one or more neighbouring
*     pixels that are not inside a clump). These three quality bits have
*     names associated with them which can be used with the KAPPA
*     applications SETQUAL, QUALTOBAD, REMQUAL, SHOWQUAL. The names used
*     are "CLUMP", "BACKGROUND" and "EDGE". For instance, to overlay
*     the outline of a set of 2D clumps held in NDF "fred" on a previously
*     displayed 2D image, do "qualtobad fred fred2 background" followed by
*     "contour noclear mode=good fred2".
*
*     - Information about each clump, including a minimal cut-out image
*     of the clump and the clump parameters, is written to the CUPID
*     extension of the output NDF (see the section "Use of CUPID Extension"
*     below).
*
*     - An output catalogue containing clump parameters can be created (see
*     parameter OUTCAT).
*
*     The algorithm used to identify the clumps (GaussCLumps, ClumpFind,
*     etc) can be specified (see parameter METHOD).

*  Usage:
*     findclumps in out outcat method

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     BACKOFF = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE, the background level in each clump is removed from the
*        clump data values before calculating the reported clump sizes and
*        centroid position (the background level used is the minimum data
*        value in the clump). If FALSE, the full data values, including
*        background, are used when calculating the clump sizes and centroid
*        position.
*
*        If BACKOFF is FALSE, a clump that sits on a high background level
*        will have a larger reported width than an identical clump sitting
*        on a lower background level. The position of the centroid may
*        also be affected by the background level. This is usually
*        undesirable, and so the default value for BACKOFF is usually TRUE.
*        The main reason you may want to set BACKOFF to FALSE is if you
*        want to compare clump properties found by FINDCLUMPS with those
*        found by the IDL version of CLUMPFIND (which includes the
*        background in its calculations). For this reason, the dynamic
*        default value got BACKOFF is TRUE, unless METHOD is "ClumpFind"
*        and the ClumpFind.IDLAlg configuration parameter is non-zero, in
*        which case the dynamic default for BACKOFF is FALSE.
*
*        Note, the other reported clump properties such as total data
*        value, peak data value, etc, are always based on the full clump
*        data values, including background. []
*     CONFIG = GROUP (Read)
*        Specifies values for the configuration parameters used by the
*        clump finding algorithms. If the string "def" (case-insensitive)
*        or a null (!) value is supplied, a set of default configuration
*        parameter values will be used.
*
*        The supplied value should be either a comma-separated list of strings
*        or the name of a text file preceded by an up-arrow character
*        "^", containing one or more comma-separated list of strings. Each
*        string is either a "keyword=value" setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^". Such text files should
*        contain further comma-separated lists which will be read and
*        interpreted in the same manner (any blank lines or lines beginning
*        with "#" are ignored). Within a text file, newlines can be used
*        as delimiters as well as commas. Settings are applied in the order
*        in which they occur within the list, with later settings over-riding
*        any earlier settings given for the same keyword.
*
*        Each individual setting should be of the form:
*
*           <keyword>=<value>
*
*        where <keyword> has the form "algorithm.param"; that is, the name
*        of the algorithm, followed by a dot, followed by the name of the
*        parameter to be set. If the algorithm name is omitted, the current
*        algorithm given by parameter METHOD is assumed. The parameters
*        available for each algorithm are listed in the "Configuration
*        Parameters" sections below. Default values will be used for any
*        unspecified parameters. Assigning the value "<def>" (case
*        insensitive) to a keyword has the effect of reseting it to its
*        default value. Unrecognised options are ignored (that is, no error
*        is reported). [current value]
*     DECONV = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        Determines if the clump properties stored in the output catalogue
*        and NDF extension should be corrected to remove the effect of the
*        instrumental beam width specified by the FwhmBeam and VeloRes
*        configuration parameters. If TRUE, the clump sizes will be
*        reduced and the peak values increased to take account of the
*        smoothing introduced by the beam width. If FALSE, the undeconvolved
*        values are stored in the output catalogue and NDF. Note, the filter
*        to remove clumps smaller than the beam width is still applied, even
*        if DECONV is FALSE. [TRUE]
*     MSG_FILTER = _CHAR (Read)
*        Controls the amount of diagnostic information reported. It
*        uses the standard message filtering system. It should be in
*        the range 0 to 6 (NONE, QUIET, NORM, VERB, DEBUG,
*        DEBUG1-3). A value of NONE (zero) will suppress all screen
*        output. Larger values give more information (the precise
*        information displayed depends on the algorithm being used).
*        Note, this screen output describes the progress of the
*        specific clump finding algorithm selected using the METHOD
*        parameter, and therefore clump parameters such as clump size,
*        etc, will be displayed using the definition most natural to
*        the chosen algorithm. These definitions may not be the same
*        as those used to create the output catalogue, since the
*        output catalogue contains standardised columns chosen to
*        allow comparison between different algorithms. For instance,
*        the clump sizes displayed on the screen by the GaussClumps
*        algorithm will be FWHM in pixels, but the clump sizes stored
*        in the output catalogue are the RMS deviation of each pixel
*        centre from the clump centroid, weighted by the corresponding
*        pixel data value. [NORM]
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The 1, 2 or 3 dimensional NDF to be analysed.
*     JSACAT = NDF (Read)
*        An optional JSA-style output catalogue in which to store the clump
*        parameters (for KAPPA-style catalogues see parameter "OUTCAT"). No
*        catalogue will be produced if a null (!) value is supplied.
*        The created file will be a FITS file containing a binary table.
*        The columns in this catalogue will be the same as those created
*        by the "OUTCAT" parameter, but the table will in also hold the
*        contents of the FITS extension of the input NDF, and CADC-style
*        provenance headers. Note, an error will be reported if the current
*        co-ordinate system of the input NDF does not include a pair of
*        celestial longitude and latitude axes. The default for parameter
*        SHAPE is changed to "Polygon" if a JSA-style catalogue is being
*        created. [!]
*     LOGFILE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The name of a text log file to create. If a null (!) value is
*        supplied, no log file is created. [!]
*     METHOD = LITERAL (Read)
*        The algorithm to use. Each algorithm is described in more detail
*        in the "Algorithms:" section below. Can be one of:
*
*        - GaussClumps
*        - ClumpFind
*        - Reinhold
*        - FellWalker
*
*        Each algorithm has a collection of extra tuning values which are
*        set via the CONFIG parameter.   [current value]
*     NCLUMPS = _INTEGER (Write)
*        The total number of clumps descrriptions stored within the output
*        NDF (and catalogue).
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        The output NDF which has the same shape and size as the input NDF.
*        Information about the identified clumps and the configuration
*        parameters used will be stored in the CUPID extension of this NDF.
*        See "Use of CUPID Extension" below for further details about the
*        information stored in the CUPID extension. Other applications within
*        the CUPID package can be used to display this information in
*        various ways. The information written to the DATA array of this NDF
*        depends on the value of the METHOD parameter. If METHOD is
*        GaussClumps, the output NDF receives the sum of all the fitted
*        Gaussian clump models including a global background level chosen to
*        make the mean output value equal to the mean input value. If METHOD
*        is ClumpFind, FellWalker or Reinhold, each pixel in the output is
*        the integer index of the clump to which the pixel has been assigned.
*        Bad values are stored for pixels which are not part of any clump.
*        The output NDF will inherit the AXIS and WCS components (plus any
*        extensions) from the input NDF.
*     OUTCAT = FILENAME (Write)
*        An optional KAPPA-style output catalogue in which to store the clump
*        parameters (for JSA-style catalogues see parameter "JSACAT"). No
*        catalogue will be produced if a null (!) value is supplied. The
*        following columns are included in the output catalogue:
*
*        - Peak1: The position of the clump peak value on axis 1.
*        - Peak2: The position of the clump peak value on axis 2.
*        - Peak3: The position of the clump peak value on axis 3.
*        - Cen1: The position of the clump centroid on axis 1.
*        - Cen2: The position of the clump centroid on axis 2.
*        - Cen3: The position of the clump centroid on axis 3.
*        - Size1: The size of the clump along pixel axis 1.
*        - Size2: The size of the clump along pixel axis 2.
*        - Size3: The size of the clump along pixel axis 3.
*        - Sum: The total data sum in the clump.
*        - Peak: The peak value in the clump.
*        - Volume: The total number of pixels falling within the clump.
*
*        There is also an optional column called "Shape" containing an
*        STC-S description of the spatial coverage of each clump. See
*        parameter SHAPE.
*
*        The coordinate system used to describe the peak and centroid
*        positions is determined by the value supplied for parameter
*        WCSPAR. If WCSPAR is FALSE, then positions are specified in the
*        pixel coordinate system of the input NDF. In addition, the clump
*        sizes are specified in units of pixels, and the clump volume is
*        specified in units of cubic pixels (square pixels for 2D data).
*        If WCSPAR is TRUE, then positions are specified in the current
*        coordinate system of the input NDF. In addition, the clump
*        sizes and volumes are specified in WCS units. Note, the sizes
*        are still measured parallel to the pixel axes, but are recorded
*        in WCS units rather than pixel units. Celestial coordinate
*        positions are units of degrees, sizes are in units are
*        arc-seconds, and areas in square arc-seconds. Spectral coordinates
*        are in the units displayed by the KAPPA command "ndftrace".
*
*        If the data has less than 3 pixel axes, then the columns
*        describing the missing axes will not be present in the catalogue.
*
*        The catalogue inherits any WCS information from the input NDF.
*
*        The "size" of the clump on an axis is the RMS deviation of each
*        pixel centre from the clump centroid, where each pixel is weighted
*        by the corresponding pixel data value. For a Gaussian profile,
*        this "size" value is equal to the standard deviation of the Gaussian.
*        Optionally, the weights can be be based on the pixel data value
*        after removal of the background - see parameter BACKOFF). If
*        parameter DECONV is set TRUE, the values stored for "Size..." and
*        "Peak" are corrected to take account of the smoothing introduced by
*        the instrumental beam. These corrections reduced the "size..." values
*        and increase the peak value. Beam sizes are specified by configuration
*        parameters FWHMBeam and VeloRes.
*
*        For the GaussClump algorithm, the Sum and Volume values refer
*        to the part of the Gaussian within the level defined by the
*        GaussClump.ModelLim configuration parameter.
*
*        The values used for configuration parameters and ADAM parameters
*        are written to the history information of the output catalogue.
*
*        The KAPPA command "listshow" can be used to draw markers at the
*        central positions of the clumps described in a catalogue. For
*        instance, the command "listshow fred plot=mark" will draw
*        markers identifying the positions of the clumps described in
*        file fred.FIT, overlaying the markers on top of the currently
*        displayed image. Specifying "plot=STCS" instead of "plot=mark"
*        will cause the spatial outline of the clump to be drawn if it is
*        present in the catalogue (see parameter SHAPE). [!]
*     PERSPECTRUM = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        This parameter is ignored unless the supplied input NDF is
*        3-dimensional and includes a spectral axis. If so, then a TRUE
*        value for PERSPECTRUM will cause all spectra within the supplied
*        cube to be processed independenly of the neighbouring spectra.
*        That is, each identified clump will contain pixels from only a
*        single input spectrum. If a clump extends across multiple
*        spectra, then it will be split up into multiple clumps, one for
*        each spectrum. Currently, this parameter can only be used with
*        the FellWalker and ClumpFind methods. A value of FALSE is always
*        used for other methods. [FALSE]
*     QOUT = NDF (Write)
*        An optional output NDF that is a copy of the input NDF, except
*        that any Quality component in the input NDF is discarded and a
*        new one created. The new Quality component defines 3 flags that
*        indicate if each pixel is inside a clump, on the edge of a clump
*        or outside all clumps. If a null (!) value is supplied, no NDF is
*        created. [!]
*     REPCONF = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied, then the configuration parameters
*        supplied by the CONFIG parameter will be listed to standard
*        output. [current value]
*     RMS = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        Specifies a value to use as the global RMS noise level in the
*        supplied data array. The suggested default value is the square root
*        of the mean of the values in the input NDF's Variance component.
*        If the NDF has no Variance component, the suggested default
*        is based on the differences between neighbouring pixel values. Any
*        pixel-to-pixel correlation in the noise can result in this estimate
*        being too low. The value supplied for this parameter will be ignored
*        if the RMS noise level is also given in the configuration file
*        specified by parameter CONFIG.
*     SHAPE = LITERAL (Read)
*        Specifies the shape that should be used to describe the spatial
*        coverage of each clump in the output catalogue. It can be set to
*        "None", "Polygon" or "Ellipse". If it is set to "None", the
*        spatial shape of each clump is not recorded in the output
*        catalogue. Otherwise, the catalogue will have an extra column
*        named "Shape" holding an STC-S description of the spatial coverage
*        of each clump. "STC-S" is a textual format developed by the IVOA
*        for describing regions within a WCS - see
*        http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/STC-S.html for details.
*        These STC-S desriptions can be displayed by the KAPPA:LISTSHOW
*        command, or using GAIA. Since STC-S cannot describe regions within
*        a pixel array, it is necessary to set parameter WCSPAR to TRUE if
*        using this option. An error will be reported if WCSPAR is FALSE. An
*        error will also be reported if the WCS in the input data does not
*        contain a pair of scelestial sky axes.
*
*        - Polygon: Each polygon will have, at most, 15 vertices. If the data
*        is 2-dimensional, the polygon is a fit to the clump's outer boundary
*        (the region containing all godo data values). If the data is
*        3-dimensional, the spatial footprint of each clump is determined
*        by rejecting the least significant 10% of spatial pixels, where
*        "significance" is measured by the number of spectral channels that
*        contribute to the spatial pixel. The polygon is then a fit to
*        the outer boundary of the remaining spatial pixels.
*
*        - Ellipse: All data values in the clump are projected onto the
*        spatial plane and "size" of the collapsed clump at four different
*        position angles - all separated by 45 degrees - is found (see the
*        OUTCAT parameter for a description of clump "size"). The ellipse
*        that generates the same sizes at the four position angles is then
*        found and used as the clump shape.
*
*        In general, "Ellipse" will outline the brighter, inner regions
*        of each clump, and "Polygon" will include the fainter outer
*        regions. The dynamic default is "Polygon" if a JSA-style
*        catalogue (see parameters JSACAT) is being created, and "None"
*        otherwise. Note, if a JSA-style catalogue is neing created an
*        error will be reported if "Ellipse" or "None" is selected. []
*     WCSPAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If a TRUE value is supplied, then the clump parameters stored in
*        the output catalogue and in the CUPID extension of the output NDF,
*        are stored in WCS units, as defined by the current coordinate frame
*        in the WCS component of the input NDF (this can be inspected using
*        the KAPPA:WCSFRAME command). For instance, if the current
*        coordinate system in the 3D input NDF is (RA,Dec,freq), then the
*        catalogue columns that hold the clump peak and centroid positions
*        will use this same coordinate system. The spatial clump sizes
*        will be stored in arc-seconds, and the spectral clump size will
*        be stored in the unit of frequency used by the NDF (Hz, GHz, etc).
*        If a FALSE value is supplied for this parameter, the clump
*        parameters are stored in units of pixels within the pixel coordinate
*        system of the input NDF. The dynamic default for this parameter is
*        TRUE if the current coordinate system in the input NDF represents
*        celestial longitude and latitude in some system, plus a recogonised
*        spectral axis (if the input NDF is 3D). Otherwise, the dynamic
*        default is FALSE. Note, an error will be reported if a JSA-style
*        catalogue is being created (see parameter JSACAT) and WCSPAR is
*        set to FALSE. []

*  Use of CUPID Extension:
*     This application will create an NDF extension called "CUPID" in the
*     output NDF and will add the following components to it:
*
*     - CLUMPS: This a an array of CLUMP structures, one for each clump
*     identified by the selected algorithm. Each such structure contains
*     the same clump parameters that are written to the catalogue via
*     parameter OUTCAT. It also contains a component called MODEL which
*     is an NDF containing a section of the main input NDF which is just
*     large enough to encompass the clump. Any pixels within this section
*     which are not contained within the clump are set bad. So for instance,
*     if the input array "fred.sdf" is 2-dimensional, and an image of it has
*     been displayed using KAPPA:DISPLAY, then the outline of clump number 9
*     (say) in the output image "fred2.sdf" can be overlayed on the image
*     by doing:
*
*     contour noclear "fred2.more.cupid.clumps(9).model" mode=good labpos=\!
*
*     - CONFIG: Lists the algorithm configuration parameters used to
*     identify the clumps (see parameter CONFIG).
*
*     - QUALITY_NAMES: Defines the textual names used to identify background
*     and clump pixels within the Quality mask.

*  Algorithms:
*     - GaussClumps: Based on the algorithm described by Stutski & Gusten
*     (1990, ApJ 356, 513). This algorithm proceeds by fitting a Gaussian
*     profile to the brightest peak in the data. It then subtracts the fit
*     from the data and iterates, fitting a new ellipse to the brightest peak
*     in the residuals. This continues until the integrated data sum in the
*     fitted Gaussians reaches the integrated data sum in the input array,
*     or a series of consecutive fits are made which have peak values below a
*     given multiple of the noise level. Each fitted ellipse is taken to be a
*     single clump and is added to the output catalogue. In this algorithm,
*     clumps may overlap. Any input variance component is used to scale the
*     weight associated with each pixel value when performing the Gaussian
*     fit. The most significant configuration parameters for this algorithm
*     are: GaussClumps.FwhmBeam and GaussClumps.VeloRes which determine the
*     minimum clump size.

*     - ClumpFind: Described by Williams et al (1994, ApJ 428, 693). This
*     algorithm works by first contouring the data at a multiple of the
*     noise, then searches for peaks of emission which locate the clumps,
*     and then follows them down to lower intensities. No a priori clump
*     profile is assumed. In this algorithm, clumps never overlap. Clumps
*     which touch an edge of the data array are not included in the final
*     list of clumps.

*     - Reinhold: Based on an algorithm developed by Kim Reinhold at JAC.
*     See SUN/255 for more information on this algorithm. The edges of the
*     clumps are first found by searching for peaks within a set of 1D
*     profiles running through the data, and then following the wings of
*     each peak down to the noise level or to a local minimum. A mask is
*     thus produced in which the edges of the clumps are marked. These edges
*     however tend to be quite noisy, and so need to be cleaned up before
*     further use. This is done using a pair of cellular automata which
*     first dilate the edge regions and then erode them. The volume between
*     the edges are then filled with an index value associated with the
*     peak position. Another cellular automata is used to removed noise
*     from the filled clumps.
*
*     - FellWalker: Based on an algorithm which walks up hill along the
*     line of greatest gradient until a significant peak is reached. It then
*     assigns all pixels visited along the route to the clump associated
*     with the peak. Such a walk is performed for every pixel in the data
*     array which is above a specified background level. See SUN/255 for more
*     information on this algorithm.

*  GaussClumps Configuration Parameters:
*     GaussClumps.ExtraCols:
*        If set to a positive integer, then extra method-specific columns
*        are added to the output catalogue. If set to 1, then the catalogue
*        will include columns with names GCFWHM<i> (where <i> is 1, 2, or
*        3), holding the FWHM of the fitted Gaussian in units of pixels
*        (these FWHM values have NOT been reduced to excluded the effect of
*        the beam width), and "GCANGLE" - the spatial orientation angle (in
*        degrees, positive from +ve GRID1 axis to +ve GRID2 axis). If set
*        greater than 1, then additional columns will be included holding
*        the initial estimates for the peak and background values, the
*        number of fitting iterations used and the final ch-squared value
*        for the fit.
*     GaussClumps.FwhmBeam:
*        The FWHM of the instrument beam, in
*        pixels. The fitted Gaussians are not allowed to be smaller than
*        the instrument beam. This prevents noise spikes being fitted. In
*        addition, if application paremeter DECONV is set TRUE, the clump
*        widths written to the output catalogue are reduced (in quadrature)
*        by this amount. [2.0]
*     GaussClumps.FwhmStart:
*        An initial guess at the ratio of the typical
*        observed clump size to the instrument beam width. This is used to
*        determine the starting point for the algorithm which finds the best
*        fitting Gaussian for each clump. If no value is supplied (or if
*        FwhmBeam is zero), the initial guess at the clump size is based on
*        the local profile around the pixel with peak value. []
*     GaussClumps.MaxBad:
*        The maximum fraction of bad pixels which may be included in a clump.
*        Clumps will be excluded if they contain more bad pixels than this
*        value [0.05]
*     GaussClumps.MaxClumps:
*        Specifies a termination criterion for
*        the GaussClumps algorithm. The algorithm will terminate when
*        "MaxClumps" clumps have been identified, or when one of the other
*        termination criteria is met. [unlimited]
*     GaussClumps.MaxNF:
*        The maximum number of evaluations of the
*        objective function allowed when fitting an individual clump. Here,
*        the objective function evaluates the chi-squared between the
*        current gaussian model and the data being fitted. [100]
*     GaussClumps.MaxSkip:
*        The maximum number of consecutive failures
*        which are allowed when fitting Guassians. If more than "MaxSkip"
*        consecutive clumps cannot be fitted, the iterative fitting
*        process is terminated. [10]
*     GaussClumps.ModelLim:
*        Determines the value at which each Gaussian
*        model is truncated to zero. Model values below ModelLim times the RMS
*        noise are treated as zero. [0.5]
*     GaussClumps.NPad:
*        Specifies a termination criterion for the
*        GaussClumps algorithm. The algorithm will terminate when "Npad"
*        consecutive clumps have been fitted all of which have peak values less
*        than the threshold value specified by the "Thresh" parameter, or
*        when one of the other termination criteria is met. [10]
*     GaussClumps.RMS:
*        The global RMS noise level in the data. The
*        default value is the value supplied for parameter RMS. []
*     GaussClumps.S0:
*        The Chi-square stiffness parameter "S0" which
*        encourages the fitted gaussian value to be below the corresponding
*        value in the observed data at every point (see the Stutski & Gusten
*        paper). [1.0]
*     GaussClumps.Sa:
*        The Chi-square stiffness parameter "Sa" which
*        encourages the peak amplitude of each fitted gaussian to be close to
*        the corresponding maximum value in the observed data (see the Stutski
*        & Gusten paper). [1.0]
*     GaussClumps.Sb:
*        An additional Chi-square stiffness parameter which
*        encourages the background value to stay close to its initial value.
*        This stiffness is not present in the Stutzki & Gusten paper but is
*        added because the background value is usually determined by data
*        points which have very low weight and is thus poorly constrained. It
*        would thus be possibly to get erroneous background values without
*        this extra stiffness. [0.1]
*     GaussClumps.Sc:
*        The Chi-square stiffness parameter "Sc" which
*        encourages the peak position of each fitted gaussian to be close to
*        the corresponding peak position in the observed data (see the Stutski
*        & Gusten paper). [1.0]
*     GaussClumps.Thresh:
*        Gives the minimum peak amplitude of clumps to
*        be fitted by the GaussClumps algorithm (see also GaussClumps.NPad).
*        The supplied value is multipled by the RMS noise level before being
*        used. [2.0]
*     GaussClumps.VeloRes:
*        The velocity resolution of the instrument, in channels. The velocity
*        FWHM of each clump is not allowed to be smaller than this value. Only
*        used for 3D data. In addition, the velocity width of each clump
*        written to the output catalogue is reduced (in quadrature) by this
*        amount. [2.0]
*     GaussClumps.VeloStart:
*        An initial guess at the ratio of the typical
*        observed clump velocity width to the velocity resolution. This is used to
*        determine the starting point for the algorithm which finds the best
*        fitting Gaussian for each clump. If no value is supplied (or if
*        VeloRes is zero), the initial guess at the clump velocity width is
*        based on the local profile around the pixel with peak value. Only used
*        for 3D data. []
*     GaussClumps.Wmin:
*        This parameter, together with GaussClumps.Wwidth, determines which
*        input data values are used when fitting a Gaussian to a given peak
*        in the data array. It specifies the minimum normalised weight which
*        is to be used. Pixels with normalised weight smaller than this value
*        are not included in the fitting process. The absolute weight values
*        are normalised by dividing them by a value equal to the mean of the
*        absolute weights plus four standard deviations. An iterative sigma
*        clipping algorithm is used when calculating this value in order to
*        eliminate the effects of any pixel that have unusually low variance
*        values, and thus unusually high absolute weights. [0.05]
*     GaussClumps.Wwidth:
*        This parameter, together with GaussClumps.Wmin,
*        determines which input data values are used when fitting a Gaussian to
*        a given peak in the data array. It is the ratio of the width of the
*        Gaussian weighting function (used to weight the data around each clump
*        during the fitting process), to the width of the initial guess Guassian
*        used as the starting point for the Gaussian fitting process. The
*        Gaussian weighting function has the same centre as the initial guess
*        Gaussian. [2.0]

*  ClumpFind Configuration Parameters:
*     ClumpFind.AllowEdge:
*        If set to a zero value, then clumps are
*        rejected if they touch any edge of the data array. If non-zero, then
*        such clumps are retained. Note, other implementations of ClumpFind
*        often include such clumps but flag them in some way. [0]
*     ClumpFind.DeltaT:
*        The gap between the contour levels. Only accessed
*        if no value is supplied for "Level1", in which case the contour levels
*        are linearly spaced, starting at a lowest level given by "Tlow" and
*        spaced by "DeltaT". Note, small values of DeltaT can result in noise
*        spikes being interpreted as real peaks, whilst large values can result
*        in some real peaks being missed and merged in with neighbouring peaks.
*        The default value of two times the RMS noise level is usually considered
*        to be optimal, although this obviously depends on the RMS noise level
*        being correct. The value can be supplied either as an absolute data
*        value, or as a multiple of the RMS noise using the syntax "[x]*RMS",
*        where "[x]" is a numerical value (e.g. "3.2*RMS"). [2*RMS]
*     ClumpFind.FwhmBeam:
*        The FWHM of the instrument beam, in pixels. If
*        application paremeter DECONV is set TRUE, the clump widths written to
*        the output catalogue are reduced (in quadrature) by this amount. If a
*        direct comparison with other implementations of the ClumpFind algorithm
*        is required, DECONV should be set to FALSE. [2.0]
*     ClumpFind.IDLAlg:
*        If a non-zero value is supplied, then FINDCLUMPS
*        emulates the ClumpFind algorithm as implemented by the IDL package
*        available from Jonathan Williams WWW site on 28th April 2006. The
*        default value of zero causes FINDCLUMPS to use the algorithm
*        described in the Williams et al ApJ paper of 1994. These two
*        algorithms differ in the way that pixels within merged clumps are
*        allocated to individual clumps. Also the ApJ algorithm rejects clumps
*        that do not not extend above the second contour level, whereas the IDL
*        algorithm accepts such clumps. See also parameter BACKOFF. [0]
*     ClumpFind.Level<n>:
*        The n'th data value at which to contour the
*        data array (where <n> is an integer). Values should be given for
*        "Level1", "Level2", "Level3", etc. Any number of contours can be
*        supplied, but there must be no gaps in the progression of values for
*        <n>. The values will be sorted into descending order before being
*        used. If "Level1" is not supplied (the default), then contour levels
*        are instead determined automatically using parameters "Tlow" and
*        "DeltaT". Note clumps found at higher contour levels are traced down
*        to the lowest supplied contour level, but any new clumps which are
*        initially found at the lowest contour level are ignored. That is, clumps
*        must have peaks which exceed the second lowest contour level to be
*        included in the returned catalogue. The values can be supplied either
*        as absolute data values, or as mutliples of the RMS noise using the
*        syntax "[x]*RMS", where "[x]" is a numerical value (e.g. "3.2*RMS").[]
*     ClumpFind.MaxBad:
*        The maximum fraction of pixels in a clump that are allowed to be
*        adjacent to a bad pixel. If the fraction of clump pixels adjacent to
*        a bad pixel exceeds this value, the clump is excluded. If a direct
*        comparison with other implementations of the ClumpFind algorithm is
*        required, a value of 1.0 should be used. [0.05]
*     ClumpFind.MinPix:
*        The lowest number of pixel which a clump can
*        contain. If a candidate clump has fewer than this number of pixels,
*        it will be ignored. This prevents noise spikes from being interpreted
*        as real clumps. The default value is based on the supplied values
*        for the other parameters that specify the minimum peak height, the
*        background level and the instrumental beam widths, limited to be at
*        least 16 pixels (for 3D data), 7 pixels (for 2D data) or 3 pixels
*        (for 1D data, or if "PERSPECTRUM" is set TRUE). If a direct comparison
*        with other implementations of the ClumpFind algorithm is required, a
*        value of 5 should be used (for 3D data) or 20 (for 2D data). []
*     ClumpFind.Naxis:
*        Controls the way in which contiguous areas of
*        pixels are located when contouring the data. When a pixel is found
*        to be at or above a contour level, the adjacent pixels are also checked.
*        "Naxis" defines what is meant by an "adjacent" pixel in this sense.
*        The supplied value must be at least 1 and must not exceed the number
*        of pixel axes in the data. The default value equals the number of
*        pixel axes in the data. If the data is 3-dimensional, any given pixel
*        can be considered to be at the centre of a cube of neighbouring pixels.
*        If "Naxis" is 1 only those pixels which are at the centres of the cube
*        faces are considered to be adjacent to the central pixel. If "Naxis"
*        is 2, pixels which are at the centre of any edge of the cube are also
*        considered to be adjacent to the central pixel. If "Naxis" is 3, pixels
*        which are at the corners of the cube are also considered to be adjacent
*        to the central pixel. If the data is 2-dimensional, any given pixel can
*        be considered to be at the centre of a square of neighbouring pixels.
*        If "Naxis" is 1 only those pixels which are at the centres of the
*        square edges are considered to be adjacent to the central pixel. If
*        "Naxis" is 2, pixels which are at square corners are also considered
*        to be adjacent to the central pixel. For one dimensional data, a
*        value of 1 is always used for "Naxis", and each pixel simply has 2
*        adjacent pixels, one on either side. Note, the supplied "naxis"
*        value is ignored if the ADAM parameter "PERSPECTRUM" is set TRUE. []
*     ClumpFind.RMS:
*        The global RMS noise level in the data. The
*        default value is the value supplied for parameter RMS. []
*     ClumpFind.Tlow:
*        The lowest level at which to contour the data
*        array. Only accessed if no value is supplied for "Level1". See also
*        "DeltaT". The value can be supplied either as an absolute data
*        value, or as a mutliple of the RMS noise using the syntax "[x]*RMS",
*        where "[x]" is a numerical value (e.g. "3.2*RMS"). [2*RMS]
*     ClumpFind.VeloRes:
*        The velocity resolution of the instrument, in
*        channels. The velocity width of each clump written to the output
*        catalogue is reduced (in quadrature) by this amount. If a direct
*        comparison with other implementations of the ClumpFind algorithm is
*        required, a value of zero should be used. [2.0]

*  Reinhold Configuration Parameters:
*     Reinhold.FwhmBeam:
*        The FWHM of the instrument beam, in pixels. If
*        application paremeter DECONV is set TRUE, the clump widths written to
*        the output catalogue are reduced (in quadrature) by this amount. [2.0]
*     ReinholdClumps.MaxBad:
*        The maximum fraction of pixels in a clump that are allowed to be
*        adjacent to a bad pixel. If the fraction of clump pixels adjacent
*        to a bad pixel exceeds this value, the clump is excluded. [0.05]
*     Reinhold.MinLen:
*        The minimum number of pixels spanned by a peak
*        along any one dimension in order for the peak to be considered
*        significant. If a peak is spanned by fewer than this number of pixels
*        on any axis, then it is ignored. [4]
*     Reinhold.MinPix:
*        The lowest number of pixel which a clump can
*        contain. If a candidate clump has fewer than this number of pixels,
*        it will be ignored. This prevents noise spikes from being interpreted
*        as real clumps. The default value is based on the supplied values
*        for the other parameters that specify the minimum peak height, the
*        background level and the instrumental beam widths, limited to be at
*        least 16 pixels(for 3D data), 7 pixels (for 2D data) or 3 pixels
*        (for 1D data). []
*     Reinhold.Noise:
*        Defines the data value below which pixels are
*        considered to be in the noise. A peak is considered to end when the
*        peak value dips below the "noise" value. The value can be supplied
*        either as an absolute data value, or as a mutliple of the RMS noise
*        using the syntax "[x]*RMS", where "[x]" is a numerical value (e.g.
*        "3.2*RMS"). [2*RMS]
*     Reinhold.Thresh:
*        The smallest significant peak height. Peaks which
*        have a maximum data value less than this value are ignored. The value
*        can be supplied either as an absolute data value, or as a mutliple of
*        the RMS noise using the syntax "[x]*RMS", where "[x]" is a numerical
*        value (e.g. "3.2*RMS"). [Noise+2*RMS]
*     Reinhold.FlatSlope:
*        A peak is considered to end when the slope of a
*        profile through the peak drops below this value. The value should be
*        given as a change in data value between adjacent pixels. The value can
*        be supplied either as an absolute data value, or as a mutliple of the
*        RMS noise using the syntax "[x]*RMS", where "[x]" is a numerical value
*        (e.g. "3.2*RMS"). [1.0*RMS]
*     Reinhold.CAThresh:
*        Controls the operation of the cellular automata
*        which is used to erode the (previously dilated) edges regions prior to
*        filling them with clump indices. If the number of edge pixels in
*        the 3x3x3 pixel cube (or 2x2 pixel square for 2D data) surrounding
*        any pixel is greater than CAThresh, then the central pixel is
*        considered to be an edge pixel. Otherwise it is not considered to be
*        an edge pixel. The default value is one less than the total number
*        of pixels in the square or cube (i.e. 8 for 2D data and 26 for 3D
*        data). []
*     Reinhold.CAIterations:
*        This gives the number of times to apply
*        the cellular automata which is used to erode the edges regions prior
*        to filling them with clump indices. [1]
*     Reinhold.FixClumpsIterations:
*        This gives the number of times to
*        apply the cellular automata which cleans up the filled clumps. This
*        cellular automata replaces each output pixel by the most commonly
*        occuring value within a 3x3x3 cube (or 2x2 square for 2D data) of input
*        pixels centred on the output pixel. [1]
*     Reinhold.RMS:
*        The global RMS noise level in the data. The
*        default value is the value supplied for parameter RMS. []
*     Reinhold.VeloRes:
*        The velocity resolution of the instrument, in
*        channels. The velocity width of each clump written to the output
*        catalogue is reduced (in quadrature) by this amount. [2.0]

*  FellWalker Configuration Parameters:
*     FellWalker.AllowEdge:
*        If set to a zero value, then clumps are
*        rejected if they touch any edge of the data array. If non-zero, then
*        such clumps are retained. [1]
*     FellWalker.CleanIter:
*        This gives the number of times to apply the
*        cellular automata which cleans up the filled clumps. This cellular
*        automata replaces each clump index by the most commonly occuring
*        value within a 3x3x3 cube (or 2x2 square for 2D data) of neighbours.
*        The supplied value is ignored and a value of zero is assumed if
*        "PERSPECTRUM" is set TRUE. [1]
*     FellWalker.FlatSlope:
*        Any initial section to a walk which has an average gradient (measured
*        over 4 steps) less than this value, and for which the data value is
*        less than "NOISE + 2*RMS", will not be included in the clump. The value
*        of this parameter is the data increment between pixels, and can be
*        supplied either as an absolute data value, or as a mutliple of the RMS
*        noise using the syntax "[x]*RMS", where "[x]" is a numerical value (e.g.
*        "3.2*RMS"). [1.0*RMS]
*     FellWalker.FwhmBeam:
*        The FWHM of the instrument beam, in pixels. If
*        application paremeter DECONV is set TRUE, the clump widths written to
*        the output catalogue are reduced (in quadrature) by this amount. [2.0]
*     FellWalker.MaxBad:
*        The maximum fraction of pixels in a clump that are allowed to be
*        adjacent to a bad pixel. If the fraction of clump pixels adjacent
*        to a bad pixel exceeds this value, the clump is excluded. [0.05]
*     FellWalker.MinDip:
*        If the dip between two adjacent peaks is less
*        than this value, then the peaks are considered to be part of the
*        same clump. The value can be supplied either as an absolute data
*        value, or as a mutliple of the RMS noise using the syntax "[x]*RMS",
*        where "[x]" is a numerical value (e.g. "3.2*RMS"). [2.0*RMS]
*     FellWalker.MinHeight:
*        If the peak value in a clump is less than
*        this value then the clump is not included in the returned list of
*        clumps. The value can be supplied either as an absolute data
*        value, or as a mutliple of the RMS noise using the syntax "[x]*RMS",
*        where "[x]" is a numerical value (e.g. "3.2*RMS"). [Noise]
*     FellWalker.MinPix:
*        The lowest number of pixel which a clump can
*        contain. If a candidate clump has fewer than this number of pixels,
*        it will be ignored. This prevents noise spikes from being interpreted
*        as real clumps. The default value is based on the supplied values
*        for the other parameters that specify the minimum peak height, the
*        background level and the instrumental beam widths, limited to be at
*        least 16 pixels (for 3D data), 7 pixels (for 2D data) or 3 pixels
*        (for 1D data). []
*     FellWalker.MaxJump:
*        Defines the extent of the neighbourhood about a
*        local maximum which is checked for higher pixel values. The
*        neighbourhood checked is  square or cube with side equal to twice the
*        supplied value, in pixels. [4]
*     FellWalker.Noise:
*        Defines the data value below which pixels are
*        considered to be in the noise. No walk will start from a pixel with
*        data value less than this value. The value can be supplied either as
*        an absolute data value, or as a mutliple of the RMS noise using the
*        syntax "[x]*RMS", where "[x]" is a numerical value (e.g. "3.2*RMS").
*        [2*RMS]
*     FellWalker.RMS:
*        The global RMS noise level in the data. The
*        default value is the value supplied for parameter RMS. []
*     FellWalker.VeloRes:
*        The velocity resolution of the instrument, in
*        channels. The velocity width of each clump written to the output
*        catalogue is reduced (in quadrature) by this amount. [2.0]
