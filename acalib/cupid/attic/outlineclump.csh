#  Name:
#     OUTLINECLUMP

#  Purpose:
#     Draw an outline around a 2-dimensional clump identified by CUPID.

#  Language:
#     C-shell

#  Type of Module:
#     C-shell script

#  Description:
#     This procedure will outline a specified clump previously identified
#     by CUPID:FINDCLUMPS or CUPID:EXTRACTCLUMPS. The data must be
#     2-dimensional, and the image over which the outline is to be drawn
#     must have been displayed previously using KAPPA:DISPLAY.

#  Usage:
#     outlineclump ndf index [style]

#  ADAM Parameters:
#     NDF = NDF (Read)
#        The name of the NDF containing the clump information. This NDF
#        should have been created using the CUPID:FINDCLUMPS or
#        CUPID:EXTRACTCLUMPS command. The clump cut-out images contained in
#        the CUPID extension of this NDF will be used to define the outline
#        of the clump.
#     INDEX = _INTEGER (Read)
#        The integer index or indices of the clumps to be identified.
#        For multiple indices supply a comma-separated list, using
#        hyphens to express ranges.  For example "2,4-6,9" would draw
#        the outlines of clumps with indices 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
#     STYLE = LITERAL (Read)
#        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to
#        use for the outline.
#
#        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
#        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
#        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
#        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
#        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are
#        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
#        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
#        same attribute.
#
#        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
#
#           <name>=<value>
#
#        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
#        is the value to assign to the attribute. Default values will be
#        used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
#        defaulted if a null value (!) is supplied.  See section
#        "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description of the
#        available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are ignored
#        (no error is reported).
#
#        The appearance of the clump outline is controlled by the attributes
#        Colour(Curves), Width(Curves), etc (the synonym Contours may be
#        used in place of Curves). The contour appearance established in
#        this way may be modified using parameters PENS, PENROT and
#        DASHED.  [current value]

#  Examples:
#     outlineclump m51b 2 style="'colour=blue,width=4'"
#        This draws an outline of the second clump (as stored in
#        m51b.more.cupid.clumps(2).model) on the current graphics device,
#        using a blue line of four times the default thickness.

#  Notes:
#     -  The script is simply a wrapper for the KAPPA command:
#
#     contour ndf="$ndf.more.cupid.clumps($index).model" labpos=\! mode=good clear=no
